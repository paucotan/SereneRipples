Serene Ripples is a meditative app designed for enjoying music as if listening to it next to a lake. It provides a visual representation of sound waves and creates a calming, immersive experience.

Developed by Paul Cohen (@enjoypolosfu) in collaboration with Cursor AI and with the assistance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
